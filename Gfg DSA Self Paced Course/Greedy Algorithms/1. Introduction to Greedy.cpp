// Greedy is used to find the solution with least possible resources.

//It is usually used to solve the standard Problems resulting in their optuimal solution:
//Finding Optimal Solutions

// 1. Activity Selection Problem
// 2. Fractional Knapsack Problem
// 3. Job Sequencing
// 4. Prim's Algorithm for MST
// 5. Kruskal's Algorithm for MST
// 6. Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest path Algorithm
// 7. Huffman Coding {An Optimal Lossless Compression Technique }



//Also , it is also used to find the optimal Solutions for NP Hard Problems like Travelling Salesman Problem.
// It is For sure that if the optimal solution is O(n) of NP Hard problem, then Greedy will never give give you a solution more than O(2n), i.e Within Bounds.
