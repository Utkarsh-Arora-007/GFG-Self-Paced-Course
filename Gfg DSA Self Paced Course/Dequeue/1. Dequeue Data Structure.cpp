//Main Operations 
// 1. insertFront()
// 2. insertRear()
// 3. deleteFront()
// 4. deleteRear()


//additional Operations of Dequeue
// 1. getFront()
// 2. getRear()
// 3. IsFull()
// 4. isEmpty()
// 5. size()



//Implementation of Dequeue
// 1. Linked List :  Doubly linked List with front and rear pointers

// We do not use Singly Linked List because it is not possible to perform deletion at tail in dequeue in O(1) time.

// 2. Array : Circular Array with front and rear indexes. We can also use front a size and can get rear using size.



// Applications of Dequeue Data Structure
// 1. A dequeue can be used as both stack and queue.
// 2. Maintaining History of Actions.
// 3. A Steal Process Scheduling Algorithm.
// 4. Implementing a Priority Queue with two types of priorities.
// 5. Maximum/Minimum of all subarrays of size k in an array.
