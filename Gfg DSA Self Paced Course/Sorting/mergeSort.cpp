//it is a divide and conquer algorithm
//stable algorithm
//O(nlogn) time complexity where Theta(logn) are the total no. of levels and Theta(n) is the total work done at each level and O(n) Aux. Space
// Well suited for linked lists. Works in O(1) aux. space.
// Used in external sorting.

//In general for arrays (not for linked lists), quicksort outperforms mergeSort.
