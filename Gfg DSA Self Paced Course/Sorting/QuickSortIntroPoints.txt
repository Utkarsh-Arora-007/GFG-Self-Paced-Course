Quick sort Introduction:
1. It is a Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
2. Worst Case Time: O(n^2)
3. Despite O(n^2) worst case, it is considered faster, because of the following reasons:
    a> it is In-place algorithm.
    b> it is Code-Friendly.
    c> Average Case of Time Complexity is O(nlogn)
    d> It is Tail Recursive.

4. Partitioning Algo is the Key Function (Naive(stable but slow), Lomuto(faster but unstable), Hoare(fastest and most efficient but unstable)).
