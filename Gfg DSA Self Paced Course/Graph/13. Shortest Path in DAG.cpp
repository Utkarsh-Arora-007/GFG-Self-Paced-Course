// One simple solution is to use single-source shortest path algorithm.
// Like Bellman - Ford Algo in O(VE) time
// and Dijkstra's Algo in O(ElogV) time (Which is much better than Bellman-Ford Algo)



// Now the best solution for this problem is to use topological - sorting in O(V+E) time 


//Very Hard Solution, Not possible for me to remember and code.
